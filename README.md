# Pong

Simple Pong game using python's turtle module. The original idea for this is from @TokyoAdTech
This is a rewrite I created using his tutorial to gain some knowledge on how to create simple GUIs. 

Next Steps:
- [ ] Define classes
- [ ] Remove while True loop -> add exit option and game winner after a certain amount of points are played.
- [ ] Add "Level Up" option that increases game speed
- [ ] Make ball stop in center after points are scored to let users decide when to start new round.
- [ ] Block paddles from going off screen
